# Bear Classifier â€“ Training Notebook

Training notebook for a bear image classifier using fastai and transfer learning.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to train an image classifier that distinguishes between grizzly bears, black bears, and teddy bears. The model was built using the fastai library and fine-tuned from a pre-trained `resnet18` backbone.

The resulting `.pkl` file is used in production on Hugging Face Spaces:
